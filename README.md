## Procedural Generation with Biome
This projects implement procedural generation with biome. I initially developed the all projects based on the sebastian's procedual generation tutorial. There is lots of modification at the base code. I remove useless features at begining. Also I add random generation features and biome. I implement texture of terrain with Texture2DArray. 

## Further works
I have plan to develop mincraft style, block aditing game. This project is starting project for implementing minecraft at unity. 

To do.
1. Refactoring all codes.
2. Implementing more nature way to select hyper-parameters of the scene informations.
3. Find better way to find biome at initial steps.
4. Threading and speed up!
